It uses a custom build of [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and desktop apps via 3rd party tools like Cocoon, Cordova and Electron.\r\n\r\nAlong with the fantastic open source community Phaser is actively developed and maintained by [Photon Storm Limited](http://www.photonstorm.com). As a result of rapid support and a developer friendly API Phaser is currently one of the [most starred](https://github.com/showcases/javascript-game-engines) game frameworks on GitHub.\r\n\r\nThousands of developers worldwide use it. From indies and multi-national digital agencies to schools and Universities. Each creating their own incredible games.

Scan through the [Change Log](#change-log) for comprehensive details about what is new and updated in this version.\r\n\r\nAs always, my thanks to all of you who contributed towards this release. Either by opening an issue on GitHub, providing a fix, or just giving encouragement to the dev team.\r\n\r\nWe are now splitting our time between development of [Lazer](#lazer), and Phaser 2.5. We decided, after much discussion with the community, that we owed it to Phaser to go out on a high, so 2.5 will be the version in which we do just that. After this Phaser will enter the LTS (long-term support) stage of its life.\r\n\r\nThis is when we impose a feature freeze, locking the API down and responding only to bugs. This is a necessary step to allow us to focus on Lazer while still ensuring Phaser is given the support it deserves. Don't worry, we aren't going to abandon you! We've got your backs.\r\n\r\nAs always, keep you eyes on the Phaser web site and read our weekly [newsletter](#phaserworld). You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photonstorm) or chat to me in the Phaser [Slack](http://phaser.io/news/2015/08/phaser-slack-channel) channel.\r\n\r\nWe'd be extremely grateful if you could get involved with our [Phaser Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm). The uptake so far has been fantastic. Thank you to everyone who now supports Phaser development and shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming, and Phasers role in that.\r\n\r\nHappy coding everyone! See you on the forums.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nRich - [@photonstorm](https://twitter.com/photonstorm)\r\n\r\n![boogie](http://www.phaser.io/images/spacedancer.gif)\r\n\r\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"patreon\"></a>\r\n## Support Phaser on Patreon\r\n\r\n![patreon](http://www.phaser.io/images/patreon.png)\r\n\r\nPlease help support the future development of Phaser / Lazer through our [Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm).

From setting up a web server, to picking an IDE and coding your first game. Please start here no matter what your game-dev experience, before diving in to the API.\r\n\r\nThe single biggest Phaser resource is the [Phaser web site](http://phaser.io/news). It has hundreds of tutorials listed and fresh ones are added every week. Keep coming back to see what's new!\r\n\r\nUsing Phaser with **TypeScript**? Check out this great series of [Game From Scratch](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Adventures-in-Phaser-with-TypeScript-tutorial-series.aspx) tutorials.\r\n\r\nPrefer **videos** to reading?

Currently there are over 700 of them!\r\n\r\nBrowse the [Phaser Examples](http://phaser.io/examples) or clone the [examples repo][examples] and eat your heart out!\r\n\r\n### Interphase\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"http://phaser.io/content/interphase/1/images/editorial/pages.jpg\"></div>\r\n\r\n[Interphase](http://phaser.io/interphase) is a programming book for Phaser developers of all skill levels.\r\n\r\nWith 400 pages of content you'll find detailed articles, game development \"Making Of\" guides and tutorials. All were written using the latest version of Phaser, so you won't be learning any out-dated tricks here.\r\n\r\nAs well as the book you get all the source code, graphics and assets to go with it, and lots of extras too.\r\n\r\n[Read More](http://phaser.io/interphase)\r\n\r\n### Phaser Editor - A complete Phaser Editor\r\n\r\n[Phaser Editor](http://phasereditor.boniatillo.com/) is a brand new Eclipse based editor that offers lots of built-in tools specifically for Phaser developers. Handy features include Smart code auto-completion, built-in web server, documentation search, asset management, texture atlas creator, audio sprite creator, asset previews and lots more.\r\n\r\n### Game Mechanic Explorer\r\n\r\nThe [Game Mechanic Explorer](http://gamemechanicexplorer.com) is a great interactive way to learn how to develop specific game mechanics in Phaser. Well worth exploring once you've got your dev environment set-up.\r\n\r\n### Mighty Editor - Visual Game Editor\r\n\r\n[MightyEditor](http://mightyfingers.com/) is a browser-based visual Phaser game editor. Create your maps with ease, position objects and share them in seconds. It also exports to native Phaser code. Excellent for quickly setting-up levels and scenes.\r\n\r\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"using-phaser\"></a>\r\n## Using Phaser\r\n\r\nPhaser is provided ready compiled in the `build` folder of the repository. There are both plain and minified versions. The plain version is for use during development and the minified version for production.\r\n\r\n### Custom Builds\r\n\r\nPhaser includes a grunt based build system which allows you to strip out lots of additional features you may not require, saving hundreds of KB in the process. Don't use any Sound in your game? Then you can now exclude the entire sound system. Don't need Keyboard support? That can be stripped out too.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this work the minimum build size of Phaser is now just 80KB minified and gzipped.\r\n\r\nSee the [Creating a Custom Phaser Build](http://phaser.io/tutorials/creating-custom-phaser-builds) tutorial for details.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"browserify\"></a>\r\n### Browserify / CJS\r\n\r\nPhaser was never written to be modular. Everything exists under one single global namespace, and you cannot `require` selected parts of it into your builds. It expects 3 global vars to exist in order to work properly: `Phaser`, `PIXI` and `p2`. The following is one way of doing this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwindow.PIXI = require('phaser/build/custom/pixi')\r\nwindow.p2 = require('phaser/build/custom/p2')\r\nwindow.Phaser = require('phaser/build/custom/phaser-split')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you build a custom version of Phaser (see above) it will split the 3 core libs out into their own files, allowing you to require them as above.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate this is just a band-aid and not a proper use of modules, but please understand it was never built to be used this way. You're trying to fit a square peg in a round browserify-shaped hole, so compromises have to be made. Please don't open GitHub issues about it. We've no intention of changing Phaser at this stage of its life. Full module based development is being undertaken in Lazer.\r\n\r\n### Webpack\r\n\r\nStarting from Phaser 2.4.5 we now include a custom build for Webpack.\r\n\r\nYou need to add `p2` as a dependency.\r\n\r\n##### Webpack Config\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar path = require('path');\r\nvar webpack = require('webpack');\r\n\r\nvar phaserModule = path.join(__dirname, '/node_modules/phaser/');\r\nvar phaser = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/phaser-split.js'),\r\n  pixi = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/pixi.js'),\r\n  p2 = path.join(phaserModule, 'build/custom/p2.js');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    ...\r\n    module: {\r\n        loaders: [\r\n            { test: /pixi.js/, loader: \"script\" },\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    resolve: {\r\n        alias: {\r\n            'phaser': phaser,\r\n            'pixi.js': pixi,\r\n            'p2': p2,\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Main js file\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequire('pixi.js');\r\nrequire('p2');\r\nrequire('phaser');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Building from source\r\n\r\nShould you wish to build Phaser from source you can take advantage of the provided [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) scripts. Ensure you have the required packages by running `npm install` first.\r\n\r\nRun `grunt` to perform a default build to the `dist` folder.\r\n\r\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"games\"></a>\r\n## Games made with Phaser\r\n\r\nThousands of games have been made in Phaser. From game jam entries to titles by some of the largest entertainment brands in the world. Here is a tiny sample:\r\n\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/bubble-academy.png)][game10]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/woodventure.png)][game11]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/hopsop.png)][game12]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/banana-mania.png)][game13]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/salazar.png)][game14]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/phaser-shmup.png)][game15]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/trappy-trap.png)][game16]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/runaway-ruins.png)][game17]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/241/ananias.png)][game18]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot1a.jpg)][game1]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot2a.jpg)][game2]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot3a.jpg)][game3]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot4a.jpg)][game4]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot5b.jpg)][game5]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot6b.jpg)][game6]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot7b.jpg)][game7]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot8.jpg)][game8]\r\n[![Game](http://phaser.io/images/github/shot9.jpg)][game9]\r\n\r\nArtwork copyright their respective owners.\r\n\r\nWe add [new games](http://phaser.io/news/category/game) to the Phaser site weekly, so be sure to send us yours when it's finished!\r\n\r\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"requirements\"></a>\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nPhaser requires a web browser that supports the [canvas tag](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas). This includes Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera on desktop. iOS Safari, Android Browser and Chrome for Android are supported on mobile.\r\n\r\nWhile Phaser does its best to ensure a consistent cross-platform experience, always be aware of browser and device limitations. This is especially important with regard to memory and GPU limitations on mobile, and legacy browser HTML5 compatibility.\r\n\r\n### IE9\r\n\r\nIf you need to support IE9 / Android 2.x **and** use P2 physics then you must use the polyfill in the `resources/IE9 Polyfill` folder. If you don't use P2 (or don't care about IE9!) you can skip this.\r\n\r\n### JavaScript and TypeScript\r\n\r\nPhaser is developed in JavaScript. We've made no assumptions about how you like to code and were careful not to impose a strict structure upon you. You won't find Phaser split into modules, requiring a build step, or making you use a class / inheritance OOP approach. That doesn't mean you can't do so, it just means we don't *force* you to. It's your choice.\r\n\r\nIf you code with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) there are comprehensive definition files in the `typescript` folder. They are for TypeScript 1.4+.\r\n\r\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"road-map\"></a>\r\n## Road Map\r\n\r\nThe majority of Phaser development is now taking place on the [Lazer](https://github.com/photonstorm/lazer) (Phaser 3) project. The Phaser 2 branch will still be supported and issues fixed, but roadmap features have been migrated over.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"lazer\"></a>\r\n## Lazer\r\n\r\n[Lazer](https://github.com/photonstorm/lazer) is the next generation of the Phaser game framework, and was previously called Phaser 3. Using a completely ES6 base it is renderer agnostic, allowing for DOM, SVG, Canvas and WebGL rendering, across desktop and mobile web browsers.\r\n\r\n**Lazer is in active development but is not yet ready for production use.**\r\n\r\nYou can read all about the philosophy behind Lazer [here](http://phaser.io/news/2016/01/phaser-in-2015-and-beyond) or join the Google Group [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/phaser3-dev) where progress reports are posted. You can also follow progress in the Phaser World newsletter.\r\n\r\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"change-log\"></a>\r\n## Change Log\r\n\r\n## Version 2.4.8 - \"Watch Hill\" - 19th May 2016\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n* BitmapData.copy, and by extension any method that uses it, including BitmapData.draw, drawGroup and drawFull, now all support drawing RenderTexture objects. These can either be passed directly, or be the textures of Sprites, such as from a call to generateTexture.\r\n* Arcade Physics has had a new `world` argument added to the following functions: `distanceBetween`, `distanceToXY`, `distanceToPointer`, `angleBetween`, `angleToXY` and `angleToPointer`. The argument (which is false by default), when enabled will calculate the angles or distances based on the Game Objects `world` property, instead of its `x` and `y` properties. This allows it to work for objects that are placed in offset Groups, or are children of other display objects (thanks @Skeptron for the thread #2463)\r\n* Arcade Physics Body has a new property `worldBounce`. This controls the elasticity of the Body specifically when colliding with the World bounds. By default this property is `null`, in which case Body.bounce is used instead. Set this property to a Phaser.Point object in order to enable a World bounds specific bounce value (thanks @VitaZheltyakov #2465)\r\n\r\n### Updates\r\n\r\n* TypeScript definitions fixes and updates (thanks @osev7 @staff0rd @galen-manuel)\r\n* Docs typo fixes (thanks @dedoubleyou1 @mortonfox @zeterain)\r\n* You can now access the intensity of the Camera shake effect via the getter / setter `Camera.shakeIntensity`. Useful if you wish to tween the intensity while running. (thanks @drhayes #2443)\r\n* The Arcade Physics overlap method would return false if two bodies were overlapping but neither had any velocity (i.e. they were embedded into each other)\r\n* PIXI.defaultRenderer is now set to `null` in Game.destroy, allowing it to be reset if a new Game instance is created on the same page (thanks @xtforgame ##2474)\r\n* BitmapData.drawGroupProxy is now capable of iterating through Sprites that have children, and also now uses the world positions for drawing instead. This change updates the functionality of BitmapData.drawGroup.\r\n* Text.setStyle has a new argument `update` which will optionally automatically call `updateText` after setting the new style (thanks @staff0rd  #2478)\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in the Arcade Physics overlap method where it would only detect overlaps up to the max bias threshold and no further (thanks @rgk #2441)\r\n* InputHandler.checkPointerDown and checkPointerOver will now test the worldTransform scale property of a Sprite. If zero it will fast return, where-as before it would incorrectly report an up event (thanks @jaapaurelio #2466)\r\n* Fixed a bug in Arcade Physics Body.preUpdate which would incorrectly apply the position of an offset Body (one which has had Body.setSize used on it) when combined with a Sprite with a non-zero anchor (thanks @SBCGames #2470)\r\n* If you set Game.renderType to `Phaser.HEADLESS` it will no longer render the output to the canvas. The canvas is still created (although not added to the DOM), as it's required internally, but no rendering now takes place on it (thanks @ForgeableSum #2464)\r\n* Sounds played using the Audio tag, that were paused and then resumed again (either directly in code, or via a game pause event) would not resume from the point at which they paused (thanks @rroylance #2473)\r\n* Sounds played using the Audio tag, set to loop, would get caught in an endless pause-play loop cycle (thanks @rroylance #2473)\r\n\r\n### Pixi Updates\r\n\r\nPlease note that Phaser uses a custom build of Pixi and always has done. The following changes have been made to our custom build, not to Pixi in general.\r\n\r\n* Sprites that had a tint on them, that then had their frame changed via either `Sprite.frame` or `Sprite.frameName` wouldn't re-tint the new frame, and would become stuck on the old frame in Canvas mode (thaks @spayton #2453)\r\n\r\nFor changes in previous releases please see the extensive [Version History](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\n![div](http://www.phaser.io/images/github/div.png)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"contributing\"></a>\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease read the [Contributors Guide][contribute] for full details on helping with Phaser, but the main points are:\r\n\r\n- Found a bug?
